# DS-REP
This is a repository, where I keep some of my projects, that I worked on while I was a student. They are public, so that they can be viewed by potential employers. 
If you are interested in Java code, check out the activity_igra.java file, where most of the work went in.
There are also props I used in the drawable folder.
IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO WASTE TIME LOOKING AT SOME CODE, CHECK OUT "Readme" PDF FILE!
